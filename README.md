# Trendify E-commerce Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation

## üìñ Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a UK-based online retailer's sales data from 2009 to 2011. The primary goals are to uncover sales patterns, identify top-performing products and key customer demographics, and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering. The final output provides actionable recommendations to enhance marketing strategies and drive business growth.

## üéØ Business Problem

A UK-based online retailer, "Trendify," wants to leverage its transactional data to make more informed, data-driven decisions. The management team is seeking answers to the following key questions:
1. What are the overall sales trends on a monthly and quarterly basis?
2. Which are the top 10 best-selling products by revenue and quantity?
3. Who are the top 10 most valuable customers?
4. What is the geographical distribution of sales?
5. How can we segment our customers based on their purchasing behavior?

## üìä Analysis Workflow

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, corrected data types, and filtered out returns (negative quantities).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated sales trends over time, identified top-selling products by revenue and quantity, and analyzed the geographical distribution of sales.
3.  **RFM Analysis:** Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer to quantify their purchasing behavior.
4.  **K-Means Clustering:** Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=4) and segmented customers into distinct groups based on their scaled RFM metrics.
5.  **Visualization & Recommendation:** Visualized the resulting clusters and derived actionable business recommendations for each segment.
